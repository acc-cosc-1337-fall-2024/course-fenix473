//                    get_sales_tax_amount with one double parameter: meal_amount.
// b) In file hwexpressions.cpp  write function code, multiply tax_rate and meal_amount and return their
//                   product.
// c) Find file hwexpressions.h, create a double value-return function prototype named 
//                    get_tip_amount with two double parameters: meal_amount and tip_rate.
// d) In file hwexpressions.cpp, write function code to multiply  meal_amount and tip_rate, return their 
//                    product.

double get_order();

//double get_tip_amount(double base_price, double tip_amount);
